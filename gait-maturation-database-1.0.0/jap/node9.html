<P>
Representative examples of the effects of age on the stride time
fluctuations are shown in Figure 1.  The stride-to-stride variability
is largest in the four year old, lower in the seven year old, 
and smaller still in the eleven year old child. As summarized in Table 2,
there was a highly significant effect of age on variability 
(p &lt; .0001).  Both the standard deviation and coefficient of
variation (CV) were significantly larger in the 3 and 4 year olds
compared to the 6 and 7 year olds (p &lt; .0001). In addition, these
measures were significantly larger in the 6 and 7 year olds compared
to the 11 to 14 year old children (p &lt; .005).  Of note, the
stride-to-stride variability of the 11 to 14 year old children was
closest to the values obtained  in healthy, young adults (CV
= 1.3 <IMG WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline288" SRC="img6.png"> 0.1 % in the young adults and 2.1 <IMG WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline288" SRC="img6.png"> 0.1 % in
the 11 to 14 year olds).
<P>
In the representative examples shown in Figure 1, the local average of the stride time of the oldest child is relatively constant throughout the walk.  In
contrast, for the two younger children, the local average appears to
change from time to time.   Therefore, we next
addressed two questions: 1) Is the increased variability in the
younger children simply due to fatigue during this walk? 2) Is this
increased variability due to a change in rate during the walk (e.g.,
long-term slowing down or speeding up), and not indicative of
short-term, stride-to-stride unsteadiness per se?
<P>
To evaluate these questions, we detrended each time series to minimize
the effects of any local changes in average stride.  Figure 2 shows
the results for the times series shown in Figure 1.  Even after
detrending, variability is largest for the four year old child and
smallest for the oldest child.  This inverse relationship between
variability and age after detrending was found in general for all subjects as
well.  The standard deviation of the detrended time series, a measure
of the dispersion or variability, was significantly larger in the 3
and 4 year olds compared to the 6 and 7 year old (p &lt; .0001) and in
the 6 and 7 year olds compared to the oldest children (p = .004).
<P>
As a further test of these findings, we analyzed
sub-sections of each subject's time series to find the 30 consecutive
strides with the lowest CV. (A data analysis window was moved forward 5 strides at a
time across the time series and in each window the CV was
calculated). Variability during this segment should be largely
independent of a subject's speeding up or slowing down during the
trial and reflects the ``best-effort'' of the neuromuscular control
system.  For the data shown in Figures 1 and 2, the CV calculated in
this manner was 3.8, 1.9 and 1.1 % for the 4, 7 and 11 year old,
respectively.  Figure 3 shows the results of this lowest variability
time segment for all subjects.  Even during a relatively short time
period, the fluctuations from one stride to the next were significantly
increased in the 3 and 4 year olds compared to the 6 and 7 year olds
(p &lt; .0001) and in the 6 and 7 year olds compared to the oldest
children (p &lt; .0001). In fact, the CV of each of the oldest children
was lower than that of all of the 3 and 4 year old children.
<P>
Finally, to confirm that the increased variability in the younger
children was not simply due to fatigue or a change of speed during the
walk, we studied the variability of only the first 30 strides. As was the
case for the entire walk, both the standard deviation and coefficient
of variation were significantly larger in the 3 and 4 year olds
compared to the 6 and 7 year olds (p &lt; .0001) and in the 6 and 7
year olds compared to the oldest children (p &lt; .0003) (Table 2).
