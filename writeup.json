                "We began by selecting the Gait Maturation Database from PhysioNet since this aligns with our narrative goals and provides a strong foundation for interactive storytelling.",
                "Building on this, we developed a clear and cohesive narrative to guide both our visualizations and overall user experience.",
                "To inform our design decisions, we created several exploratory visualizations, which helped us better understand the dataset and finalize the concept for our main visualization.",
                "With the direction established, we set up our project website and have started shaping its structure, integrating initial visual components and explanatory content."

            "answer": [
                "One of the core interactive elements weâ€™re designing is an animated child character walking along the side of the page.",
                "The walking speed of this character will dynamically respond to the data being shown, creating a narrative-driven form of interaction.",
                "This integration of animation and data poses a significant design challenge, as it requires seamless coordination between real-time data updates and smooth animation behavior.",
                "Striking a balance between engaging motion and clarity of information will demand both technical precision and creative decision-making."
